# Signature Verification Project

Technologies / Database Used: Java, MS Access

Signature is the characteristic of the particular person &amp; hence used globally for identifying a person, validity of the documents signed, banking etc. 

Up till now, in banks where signature of a person is the basic code for transaction, the validity of the signature is generally checked by a man. 

This is a project, which simulates the ability of a man to recognize a signature from the standard signature he has. We have tried to implement a system which recognizes the signature. We deal with the signature as an image which is scanned through scanner.
